# Automated Osteoarthritis Grade Classification from X-Rays using CNNs and Transfer Learning

## Summary
This project develops a deep learning model to automatically classify the severity (grade) of knee osteoarthritis (OA) from X-ray images. By leveraging transfer learning with multiple state-of-the-art architectures (like EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and VGG16), this solution aims to provide a fast, accurate, and objective tool to support clinicians in diagnosing and staging the disease. This can help standardize diagnosis, reduce radiologist workload, and potentially lead to earlier patient intervention and improved outcomes.

## Problem
Osteoarthritis diagnosis is heavily reliant on the visual inspection of X-ray images by radiologists to assign a severity grade. This manual process faces several key challenges:
- Subjectivity: The grading can be subjective and prone to inter-observer variability, where different radiologists may assign different grades to the same image.
- Time-Consuming: Manual review is a time-intensive task, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment planning, especially in high-volume clinics.
- Resource Strain: This process can be a bottleneck, straining limited radiologist resources and diverting their time from more complex cases.

1. EDA
