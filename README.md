# Osteoarthritis Classification from X-Rays Images using CNNs

## Summary
Develope a deep learning model to classify the severity of knee osteoarthritis from X-ray images using CNN with modification layers, early stopping, and reducing learning rate, evaluation using classification report & confusion matrix for identify precission, recall, f1-score

## Problem
Osteoarthritis diagnosis is heavily reliant on the visual inspection of X-ray images by radiologists to assign a severity grade. This manual process faces several key challenges:
- Subjectivity: Objectivity is necessary when we talking with medical things
- Time-Consuming: For manual review it takes time to identify one by one image to classify severity osteoarthritis image especially for high-volume data
- Resources limitation: straining limited radiologist resources for more complex cases

## Methodology
1. EDA
2. Preprocessing & Augmentation
3. CNN Modeling (Sequential, plus modification transfer learning)
4. Evaluation

## Skills
- Programming & Data Manipulation: Python, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV (cv2)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras
- Modeling Techniques: Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning
- Specific Architectures: EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2
- Model Training & Evaluation: Data Augmentation (ImageDataGenerator), Regularization (Dropout), Callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau), Categorical Crossentropy
